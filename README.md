# Landing Page

A landing page is a static webpage where you tell about yourself to the people who are hiring employees for work or to the people who are looking to do their work.

## sections I have included in my landing page

- Name section, I made my name not to look big on the screen, just kept it small and concise as a brand name.

- A Picture section, I kept a logo picture of mine, but you can keep picture of yourself, use professional picture and background must be simple.

- Work Field section, here I kept this look bigger on the screen by show casing the field I have done, along with a tagline, you can exclude that if you want to.

- About section , introduction and journey of the field and how it is going.

- Skills section, in this section showcasing the skills learned in the field.

- Projects section, keep at most 4 main and big projects along with a small description describing about projects and Projects images or you can add image inside anchor tag that will redirect to your project live link.
